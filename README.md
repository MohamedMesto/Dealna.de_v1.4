### Manual Testing:
We conducted manual testing by simulating common user behaviors to ensure the system works as expected. The scenarios tested include:

- **Creating posts and comments**: We verified that logged-in users can successfully create, edit, and delete posts and comments, ensuring that these actions were handled correctly by the system.
- **Upvoting and downvoting posts**: We tested the voting functionality to confirm that users could only vote once per post and that votes were correctly recorded and displayed.
- **Filtering posts by category**: We checked the category filter functionality to ensure users could easily browse posts based on specific categories.
- **Handling valid and invalid inputs**: We tested the system's ability to handle both valid and invalid inputs, ensuring appropriate error messages were displayed when users submitted empty forms, invalid post data, or attempted duplicate votes.

### Automated Unit Testing:
We also wrote and ran unit tests using Django’s `unittest` framework to verify the core functionalities of the website. Below is a summary of the unit tests we implemented:

1. **Post Creation and Retrieval:**
   - We wrote tests to verify that logged-in users can create new posts and that required fields are validated.
   - We ensured that posts were correctly displayed on both the homepage and individual post pages.
   - We tested the pagination feature to confirm that posts were properly divided into pages.

2. **Comment Submission:**
   - We confirmed that logged-in users could submit comments on posts and that these comments were correctly linked to the relevant posts and displayed in the right order.
   - We ensured non-logged-in users were restricted from submitting comments.

3. **User Authentication:**
   - We created unit tests to verify that users could successfully register, log in, and log out.
   - We tested that only authenticated users could create, edit, or delete posts and comments.
   - We ensured that password reset and account management features functioned as expected.

4. **Post Voting System:**
   - We wrote tests to confirm that the upvoting and downvoting functionality worked correctly, ensuring users could only vote once per post.
   - We ensured that vote counts were updated in real-time and accurately reflected user inputs.

5. **Category Filtering:**
   - We tested the category filtering functionality to confirm that posts were correctly filtered and displayed based on the category selected.
   - We ensured users could navigate between categories without any errors.

6. **Error Handling:**
   - We validated that the system properly handled invalid inputs, such as attempts to create posts or comments with missing data or invalid forms.
   - We checked that the system displayed helpful error messages when users performed invalid actions.

### Running Tests:
To run the unit tests we created, you can use the following command in the project directory:

```bash
python manage.py test
```

This command will execute all the tests we implemented, allowing you to confirm that each core functionality works as intended. Running these tests ensures that the site remains robust and stable throughout development.

 

  

 

## Validator Testing - Bugs Fixed:

## HTML Validation

Validation errors occur when HTML code does not adhere to the established standards, which can lead to browser inconsistencies or inaccessible content. It is crucial to test your code against validators like the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure compliance with best practices and maintain cross-browser functionality. Below are two examples of common validation errors, their causes, and fixes.

 

### **Example 1: Invalid Attribute in an Element**

#### **Error**: 
`Error: Attribute comment_id not allowed on element button at this point.`

#### **Cause**:  
HTML5 does not allow custom attributes directly on elements like `<button>`. Attributes that are not globally recognized or specific to the element type will result in validation errors.

![data_comment_id](assets/images/readme_images/data_comment_id.png)



#### **Fix**:  
Use `data-*` attributes to store custom data. These attributes are valid in HTML5 and can be accessed programmatically.

 
![data_comment_id](assets/images/readme_images/data_comment_id2.png)

#### **Code Example**:  
**Before**:
```html
<button class="btn btn-delete" comment_id="13">Delete</button>
```

**After**:
```html
<button class="btn btn-delete" data-comment-id="13">Delete</button>
```

#### **JavaScript Access**:  
```javascript
const button = document.querySelector('.btn-delete');
console.log(button.dataset.commentId); // Outputs: "13"
```

### **Example 2: Invalid Width Attribute Value**

#### **Error**:  
`Error: Bad value 75% for attribute width on element img: Expected a digit but saw % instead.`

![alt text](assets/images/readme_images/width751.png)

 

#### **Cause**:  
The `width` attribute in HTML expects a numeric value in pixels, not a percentage. Using a percentage value causes a validation error.

#### **Fix**:  
Use CSS for percentage-based widths, as this is the appropriate method for responsive designs.

![alt text](assets/images/readme_images/width752.png)


#### **Code Example**:  
**Before**:
```html
<img src="/static/images/example.jpg" width="75%" alt="example image">
```

**After**:
```html
<img src="/static/images/example.jpg" alt="example image" style="width: 75%;">
```

---

### **Key Takeaways**:
- Validation errors often arise from using non-standard attributes or incorrect syntax.
- Use `data-*` attributes for custom data to comply with HTML5 standards.
- Shift layout and styling tasks to CSS for better maintainability and validation compliance.
- Regularly test your HTML with validators to ensure quality, accessibility, and browser compatibility. 

 
## CSS Validation

No CSS errors found.

## JS Validation


 

### Fixes Applied
1. **ESLint and JSHint Configuration:**
   - Added `/* eslint-env es6 */` and `/* jshint esversion: 6 */` to support ES6.
   - This explicitly tells linters that the script uses ES6 syntax.

2. **Replaced `for...of` with `Array.from().forEach`:**
   - `Array.from()` converts the `HTMLCollection` to an array, enabling the use of `forEach`.
   - Ensures compatibility with environments that may not support `for...of`.

3. **Changed `let` to `const` where variables are not reassigned:**
   - Ensures better readability and avoids unnecessary reassignments.

4. **Used `const` or `let` instead of `var`:**
   - To adhere to modern JavaScript standards.

5. **Ensured ES6 Compatibility for Template Literals and Arrow Functions:**
   - Verified ES6-compatible tools/environment usage.
   - Added notes to indicate the ES6 usage for future reference.
